# RadFM
The official code for "Towards Generalist Foundation Model for Radiology"

[Model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/chaoyi-wu/RadFM)

In this project, we collect a large-scale medical multi-modal dataset, MedMD, with **16M** 2D or **3D** images. We train a new medical multi-modal generative model RadFM on it, enabling both **2D and 3D** scans, multi-image input and visual-language interleaving cases.

## Quick Start:

For quick start, you can check the `Quick_demo` path.   
We demonstrate a simple diagnosis case here to show how to inference with our model.   
Feel free to modify it as you want.

- S1. Download [Model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/chaoyi-wu/RadFM).
- S2. Decompress the original zip file, you can get a  `pytorch_model.bin`.
- S3. put `pytorch_model.bin` under path `Quick_demo/`.
- S4. python `test.py` and you can get a conversation as:   

    > Input: <img src="https://github.com/chaoyi-wu/RadFM/blob/main/Quick_demo/view1_frontal.jpg" style="width:15px;"/> Can you identify any visible signs of Cardiomegaly in the image?    
    > Output: yes 

By the way, never try to perform this in cpu and gpu is all you need :ï¼‰.

## Pre-train:
For re-training a model on our dataset or large-scale testing our pre-train model, you can check ```src```.

Simply, ```train.py``` for training and ```test.py``` for testing.

* Check the [data_csv](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chaoyi-wu/RadFM_data_csv) to get how different datasets are processed and download them into `src/Dataset/data_csv` 
* Modify the path as you disire, and check ```src/train.py``` to pre-train or ```src/train.py``` to test.

## Case Study:

Some cases produced by our final model:
